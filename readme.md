#### Details for teaching team

* The W3 HTML validator doesn't recognize the custom DOM tags or link hrefs that Polymer needs to work. I'm not sure that it's validating all of the generated DOM or Shadow DOM elements that Polymer uses inside the app, either. The W3 CSS validator doesn't seem to recognize the D3/SVG style rules in app.css, or some of the vendor prefixes used by normalize.css or the app. Polymer is still pretty new, so I think this might be unavoidable. Otherwise, the HTML and CSS seems to validate.
